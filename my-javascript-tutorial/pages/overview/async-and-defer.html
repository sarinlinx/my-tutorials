    <h1>Adding a script to the head or bottom of body</h1>

    <h2>Placing the script in the head of HTML (NEVER DO THIS)</h2>
    <p>If JavaScript is placed in the head of HTML, it will load first and HTML will wait until the JavaScript is
      finished loading before it loads.</p>
    <p>This is a bad idea as it will impact page performance.</p>
    <p>This also executes the script before the DOM is ready.</p>

    <h2>Placing the script before closing body tag</h2>
    <p>The script should always be placed before the closnig body tag, however, this is still not perfect, because the
      script could have been downloaded before, while the HTML was still being parsed.</p>

    <h1>Async (placed in head)</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>script is loaded at the same time as the HTML is parsed.</p>
        <p>However, the HTML parsing still stops for the script execution. So the script is actually downloaded
          asynchronously. But then it's executed right away in a synchronous way. And so the HTML code has to wait for
          being parsed.</p>
        <p>one important thing about loading an async script is that the DOM content loaded event will not wait for the
          script to be downloaded and executed. So usually, DOM content loaded,</p>
        <p>usually, DOM content loaded, waits for all scripts to execute. But scripts loaded with async are an
          exception. So with async, DOM content loaded is fired off as soon as the HTML finishes parsing. And this might
          actually happen when a big script takes a long time to load, like in this example.</p>
        <p>Another very important aspect is that async scripts are not guaranteed to be executed in the exact order that
          they are declared in the code. So the script that arrives first gets executed first.</p>
        <p>for third party scripts, where the order does not matter, for example, an analytics software like Google
          Analytics, or an ad script, or something like that, then in this case, you should totally use async.</p>
        <p>for any code that your own code will not need to interact with async is just fine.</p>

    <h1>Defer (placed in head) (overall best solution)</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p> when deferring what happens is that the script is still loaded asynchronously. But the execution of the
          script is deferred until the end of the HTML parsing. So in practice, loading time is similar to the async
          attribute, but with the key difference that would defer the HTML parsing is never interrupted, because the
          script is only executed at the end.</p>
        <p>using defer, on the other hand, forces, the DOM content loaded event to only get fired
          after the whole script has been downloaded and executed. And so this is the more traditional way that this
          event works.</p>
        <p>using the defer attribute guarantees that the scripts are actually executed in the order that they are
          declared or written in the code.</p>
        <p> you should use it for your own scripts. And for scripts where the order of execution is important.</p>
        <p>For example, if your script relies on some third party library that you need to include, you will include
          that library before your own script, so that your script can then use the library's code. And in this case,
          you have to use defer and not async. Because defer will guarantee the correct order of
          execution.</p>

    <h2>Async and Defer placed in body</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>This will not work.</p>
        <p>Beause in the body, fetching and executing the script always happens after parsing the HTML anyway. And so
          async and defer have no practical effector.
