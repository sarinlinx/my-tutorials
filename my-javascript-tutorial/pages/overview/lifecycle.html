    <h1>Lifecycle</h1>



    <h1>DOMContentLoaded</h1>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-6">
        <p>This is similar to document.ready in jQuery.</p>
        <p>this event is fired by the document as soon as the HTML is completely parsed, which means that the HTML has
          been downloaded and been converted to the DOM tree.</p>
        <p> all scripts must be downloaded and executed before the DOM content loaded event can happen.</p>
        <p>Only HTML and JS need to be loaded.</p>
        <p>You can listen for the event.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <pre class="example"><span class="code-js">document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded'), function (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
</span></pre>
      </div>
    </div>





    <h1>load</h1>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-6">
        <p>fired by the window. As soon as not only the HTML is parsed, but also all the images and external resources
          like CSS files are also loaded. So basically when the complete page has finished loading is when this event
          gets fired.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <pre class="example"><span class="code-js">document.addEventListener('load'), function (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
</span></pre>
      </div>
    </div>










    <h1>beforeunload</h1>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-6">
        <p> And this event here is created immediately before a user is about to leave a page. So for example, after
          clicking this close button here in the browser tab, so we can basically use this event to ask users if they
          are 100% sure that they want to leave the page. Now in some browsers to make this work, we need to call
          prevent default here. In Chrome it's not necessary, but some browsers require it. And then we can also take a
          look at the event itself.</p>
        <p>in order to display a leaving confirmation, we need to set the return value on the event to an empty string.
          So return value and an empty string.</p>
        <p>Not possible to customize the popup message.</p>
        <p>the only time you should prompt the user, if they really want to leave the page is for example,
          when the user is leaving in the middle of filling out the form, or like writing a blog post or something like
          that. So a situation in which data could actually be lost by accident.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <pre class="example"><span class="code-js">document.addEventListener('beforeunload'), function (e) {
  e.preventDefault(); <span class="code-comment">// some browsers require this </span>
  console.log(e);
  e.returnValue = ''; <span class="code-comment">// for historical reasons </span>
}
</span></pre>
      </div>
