        <p>today, we divide our projects into multiple modules and these modules can share data between them and make
          our code more organized and maintainable.</p>
        <p>one great thing about modules is that we can also include 3rd-party modules</p>

        <p>When we are done writing our project code.
          we divided it into multiple modules
          and we included some 3rd-party modules as well.
          And so now the development step is complete.</p>
        <p> our project now needs
          to go through a build process,
          where one big final JavaScript bundle is built.
          And that's the final file,
          which we will deploy to our web server for production.</p>

        <h2>2 major steps to the build process</h2>
        <h3>1: bundle all our modules</h3>
        together into one big file.
        This is a pretty complex process
        which can eliminate unused code
        and compress or code as well.
        Now this step is super important for two big reasons. </p>
        <p>First, older browsers don't support modules at all.
          And so code that's in a module could not be executed
          by any older browser.</p>
        <p>it's also better for performance
          to send less files to the browser,
          and it's also beneficial that
          the bundling step compresses our code.</p>

        <h3>2: transpiling and polyfilling</h3>
        <p>convert
          all modern JavaScript syntax
          and features back to old ES5 syntax,
          so that even older browsers can understand
          our code without breaking. Usually done using Babel.</p>


        <h2>Build Tools</h3>
          <p> we don't perform these steps ourselves.
            Instead, we use a special tool to implement
            this build process for us.
            And the most common build tools available,
            are probably webpack and Parcel.</p>
          <p> these are called JavaScript bundlers
            because well, as the name says they take our raw code
            and transform it into a JavaScript bundle.</p>
          <h3>Webpack</h3>
          <p>Webpack is the more popular one,
            but it can be really hard and confusing to set it up.
            So that's because there's a lot of stuff
            that we need to configure manually,
            in order to make it work properly.</p>
          <h3>Parcel</h3>
          <p>Parcel, on the other hand is a zero configuration bundler,
            which simply works out of the box.
            And so in this bundler,
            we don't have to write any set up code,
            which is really amazing.</p>

        <p>you should completely avoid any kind of loops.
          And with that I mean any for loops.
          So the for, and also the for of loops,
          should be avoided if you want to avoid nested code.
          And so instead, you can use array methods like a map,
          filter and reduce.</p>
        <p> for best readability,
          always consume Promises using async/await
          and not using the den and the catch methods.
          Because these methods actually require callback functions,
          which will then introduce even more nested code.</p>
          <p>whenever you can,
            you should run Promises in parallel            
            using the Promise.all combinator function.            
            So when you have two Promises that can run at the same time,            
            so Promises that do not depend on each other,            
            then please run them in parallel            
            to make the application a little bit faster for your users.</p>
