    <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>OOP in short, is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. And paradigm simply means
          the style of the code, so the how we write and organize code.</p>

        <p>we use objects to model, so to describe aspects of the real world, like a user or a to-do list item, or even
          more abstract features like an HTML component or some kind of data structure.</p>
        <p>objects can contain data, which we call properties, and also code, which we call methods. So we can say that
          by using objects, we pack all the data and the corresponding behavior
          all into one big block.</p>
        <p> in OOP objects are self-contained pieces of code or blocks of code, like small applications on their own.
          And we then use these objects as building blocks of our applications and make objects interact with one
          another.</p>
        <p> these interactions happen through a so-called public interface, which we also call API. This interface is
          basically a bunch of methods that a code outside of the objects can access and that we use to communicate with
          the object.</p>
        <p> why does OOP actually exist? Well, this paradigm was developed with the goal of organizing code, so to make
          it more flexible and easier to maintain.</p>

    <h1>Classes</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p> in OOP, we actually need a way to generate, so to create, new objects from our code. And to do that in
          traditional OOP, we use something called classes.</p>
        <p>You can think of a class as a blueprint, which can then be used to create new objects
          based on the rules described in the class. So it's just like an architecture
          where the architect develops a blueprint to exactly plan and describe a house.
          But the blueprint is really just an abstract plan, like a set of rules,
          but nothing tangible that you can actually touch. However, from that blueprint,
          many real houses can then be built in the real world.</p>

        <p>we call all objects created through a class instances of that class.</p>
        <p>an instance is a real object that we can use in our code, which was created from a class, and a class itself
          is not an object.</p>

    <h1>Designing a class</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>4 fundamental principles of OOP.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            abstraction</li>
          <li>encapsulation</li>
          <li>
            inheritance</li>
          <li>polymorphism</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>



    <h2>Abstraction</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>abstraction basically means to ignore or to hide details that don't matter. This allows us to get an overview
          perspective of whatever it is that we're implementing instead of messing with details that don't really matter
          to our implementation.</p>

      </div>
    </div>



    <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>Encapsulation means to keep some properties and methods private inside the class so that they're not
          accessible from outside the class. However, some methods can, of course, be exposed as a public interface,
          which we call API.</p>
        <p>having these critical properties nicely encapsulated like this, we prevent external code from accidentally
          manipulating this internal state. And by the way, the term state simply refers to an object's data.</p>
        <p> in summary, we should always have the goal to nicely encapsulate most of our state and methods
          and only leaving essential methods public</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>when we have two classes that are closely related, like user and admin here, we can have one class inherit
          from the other. So we will have one parent class and one child class, and the child class then extends the
          parent class.</p>
        <p>a child class inherits all the properties and methods from its parent class.</p>
        <p>Now, in more formal terms, inheritance makes all properties and methods of a certain class available to a
          child class,
          which of course then forms a hierarchy between these two classes.</p>
        <p>And the goal of this is to reuse logic</p>
        <p> that is common to both of the classes. In this case, both the admin and the user need to log in. And so
          instead of writing that logic twice, it makes sense to inherit the login method from the more global class,
          which is the parent class user, to the more specific class, which is the child class admin.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>polymorphism means that a child class can overwrite a method that it inherited from a parent class.</p>
        <p>In this example, how do we give them different login methods?</p>
        <p> Well, it's actually quite simple. In each class we simply just write a new method, which is also called
          login. And then, according to polymorphism, that login method will overwrite the login method that has been
          inherited from the user class.</p>
