    <h1>Prototypes</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>first each and every function in JavaScript automatically has a property called prototype. And that includes,
          of course, constructor functions.</p>
        <p>every object that's created by a certain constructor function will get access to all the methods and
          properties that we define on the constructors prototype property.</p>
        <p>all the objects that are created through this constructor function here will inherit,
          so they will get access to all the methods and properties
          that are defined on this prototype property.</p>
      </div>
    </div>





    <h2>Add a method using a Prototype</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-5">
        <p>This adds a method to the Object Function using a prototype of the Person Object.</p>
        <p>Now, each object created by this constructor function will now get access to all the methods of this
          prototype property.</p>
        <p>You can then add this method on the 'jonas' Object, even though it's not part of that Object itself.</p>
        <p>Now, only 1 copy of calcAge() exists, but but then all of the objects that are created using this constructor
          function can basically reuse this function on themselves.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-7">
        <pre class="example"><span class="code-js">  const Person = function (firstName, birthYear) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.birthYear = birthYear;  
};

const jonas = new Person('Jonas', 1991);

<span class="code-comment">// Add Prototype </span>
<span class="code-highlight">Person.prototype.calcAge = function () {
  console.log(2037 - this.birthYear)
}

console.log(Person.prototype)

jonas.calcAge(); </span>
</span></pre>
      </div>
    </div>






    <h2>__proto__ property</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-5">
        <p>Every Object has a special property called __proto__</p>
        <p>
          This shows the prototype of an Object</p>
        <p>So the prototype of the Jonas object is essentially the prototype property
          of the constructor function.</p>
        <p>The result is the same as <strong>console.log(Person.prototype)</strong>.</p>
        <p>NOTE: Person.prototype is NOT the prototype of Person. It is instead what's gonna be used as the prototype of
          all the objects that are created with the person constructor function.</p>
        <p> this confusion comes from bad naming of this property. So the fact that it's called prototype
          kind of implies that this is the prototype of person,but as we just learned, it is actually not.</p>
        <p>Probably shouldn't be called prototype but instead something like .prototypeOfLinkedObjects.</p>
        <p>This would make it easier to think about how it works.</p>
        <p>Step #3 when creating a new Object constructor creates the __proto__ property.</p>
        <p>it creates this proto property and it sets its value to the prototype property of the function that is being
          called.</p>


      </div>

      <div class="col-7">
        <pre class="example"><span class="code-js">console.log(jonas.__proto__)</span>
</span></pre>
      </div>
    </div>



    <h2>isPrototypeOf</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-5">
        <p>Confirm if the prototype of the Object Function is the same as the new Object you created.</p>
        <p>This returns true.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-7">
        <pre class="example"><span class="code-js">console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(jonas))</span>
</span></pre>
      </div>
    </div>






    
    <h2>Set properties of the prototype</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-5">
        <p>You can also add a property to the prototype. All Objects created form it will then have access to it.</p>
        <p>When you view the 'jonas' Object, the new property only appears on the prototype of the Object.</p>
        <img src="../../_img/oop-add-property-to-prototype.png">     
        <p>But running <strong>jonas.species</strong> returns the string text.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-7">
<pre class="example"><span class="code-js">Person.prototype.species = 'Homo Sapiens';
console.log(jonas)
console.log(jonas.species)</span>
</span></pre>

    </div>



    <h1>Prototypal Inheritance</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>everything starts with the person the constructor function that we've been developing. Now, this constructor
          function has a prototype property which is an object and inside that object, we defined the calcAge method and
          person dot prototype itself actually also has a reference back to person which is the constructor property.
        </p>
        <p>Now remember, person dot prototype is actually not the prototype of person but of all the objects that are
          created through the person function</p>

      </div>
    </div>




    <h2>How the 'new' operator create creates an Object</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>when we call a function, any function with the new operator
          the first thing that is gonna happen is that a new empty object is created instantly.</p>
        <p>Then the this keyboard and the function call
          is set to the newly created object.
          So, inside the function's execution context
          this is now the new empty object</p>
        <p> that's why in the functions code we set the name and birth year properties on the this keyword
          because doing so will ultimately set them on the new object.</p>
        <p> now the new object is linked
          to the constructor functions prototype property.
          So in this case, person dot prototype.
          And this happens internally
          by adding the underscore, underscore protal property
          to the new object.</p>
        <p>person dot prototype is now the new objects prototype
          which is denoted in the underscore, underscore
          proto property of Jonas.
          So again, underscore proto always points
          to an object prototype
          and that is true for all objects in JavaScript.</p>
        <p>finally the new object is automatically returned
          from the function unless
          we explicitly return something else.
          But in a constructor function like person
          we usually never do that.
          Okay, and with this the result of the new operator
          and the person constructor function
          is a new object that we just created programmatically
          and that is now stored in the Jonas variable</p>
        <p>this whole process that I just explained
          is how it works with function constructors
          and also with ES6 classes
          but not with the object dot create syntax
          that we're gonna use later.</p>

    <h2>Why does it work this way?</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>here we are attempting to call the calcAge function

          on the jonas object.

          However, JavaScript can actually not find

          the calcAge function directly in the jonas object, right?

          It is simply not there</p>
        <p>if a property or a method cannot be found
          in a certain object JavaScript will look into its prototype</p>
        <p>That's how the calcAge function can run correctly and return a result.</p>
        <p>So, the jonas object inherited the calcAge method from its prototype or in other words it delegated the
          calcAge functionality to its prototype.</p>
        <p>the beauty of this

          is that we can create as many person objects as we like

          and all of them will then inherit this method.

          So we can call this calcAge method on all the person objects

          without the method being directly attached

          to all the objects themselves</p>
        <p>this is essential for code performance.

          Just imagine that we had a 1,000 objects in the code

          and if all of them would have to carry the calcAge function

          around then that would certainly impact performance.

          So instead, they can all simply use the calcAge function

          from their common prototype</p>

    <h2>Prototype Chain</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>the fact that Jonas is connected to a prototype
          and the ability of looking up methods and properties
          in a prototype is what we call the prototype chain.</p>
          <p>remember that person dot prototype itself
            is also an object
          
            and all objects in JavaScript have a prototype, right?
            
            Therefore, person dot prototype itself
            
            must also have a prototype.</p>
            <p>And the prototype of person dot prototype

              is object dot prototype.</p>
              <p>person dot prototype is just a simple object

                which means that it has been built
                
                by the built in object constructor function
                
                and this is actually the function
                
                that is called behind the scenes
                
                whenever we create an object literal.</p>
<p>what matters here

  is that person dot prototype itself  
  needs to have a prototype
    and since it has been created
  by the object constructor function
  its prototype is gonna be object dot prototype.</p>
  <p>this entire series of links

    between the objects is what is called the prototype chain</p>
    <p>and object dot prototype is usually the top
      of the prototype chain
      which means that it's prototype is null. it's underscore proto property will simply point to null
      which then marks the end of the prototype chain.</p>
      <p>in a certain way the prototype chain
        is very similar to the scope chain but with prototypes.
        So, in the scope chain
        whenever JavaScript can find a certain variable
                in a certain scope,
                it looks up into the next scope and a scope chain
                and tries to find the variable there.
                On the other hand in the prototype chain
                whenever JavaScript can find a certain property
                or method in a certain object
                it's gonna look up into the next prototype
                in the prototype chain
                and see if it can find it there, okay?</p>
                <p>So again the prototype chain is pretty similar

                  to the scope chain
                  
                  but instead of working with scopes,
                  
                  it works with properties and methods in objects, all right?</p>
