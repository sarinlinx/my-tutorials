    <h1>Consuming Promises with async/await</h1>

    <section class="code-section-container">
        <div class="code-text-section">
            <p>This is a function that keeps running in the background while performing the code inside of it</p>

            <p>When finished it returns a Promise</p>
            <p>await will stop the code execution at this point of the function until the Promise is fulfilled.</p>
            <p>stopping execution in an async function, is not a problem because this function is running asynchronously in the background.</p>
            <p>So it's not blocking the call stack. that's,what's so special about async/ await. it's the fact that it makes our code look like regular synchronous code while behind the scenes. Everything is in fact asynchronous.</p>
            <p>as soon as this premise here is resolved,then the value of this whole await expression that we havehere is going to be the resolved value of the premise.And so we can simply store that into a variable.</p>
            <p>before you start using a sync await you need to first understand that a sink await is in fact, simply syntactic sugar over the then() method in Promises.</p>
            <p>Behind the scenes, we are still using Promises. We are simply using a different way of consuming them here
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="code-block-section-w60"><pre class="example"><span class="code-js"><span class="code-comment">// Start by creating an async function by adding async in front of it </span>              
const whereAmI = async function (country) {
  <span class="code-comment">// inside create await statements that await the result of the Promise </span>                  
  cosnt res = await fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v2/name/${country}`)
  console.log(res)
}</span></pre></div>
    </section>










    <h1>try...catch</h1>
    <div class="text-section">
        <p>we can't use the catch method that we use before, because we can really attach it anywhere, right. So instead, we use something called a try catch statement.</p>
        <p>the try catch statement is actually used in regular JavaScript as well. So it's been in the language probably since the beginning. So try catch has nothing to do with a sinc/await. But we can still use it to catch errors in async functions.</p>

    </div>


    <h2>Simple example</h2>

    <section class="code-section-container">
        <div class="code-text-section">
            <p>wrap all our code in a try block. And so JavaScript will then basically try to execute this code.</p>
            <p>The catch block will have access to whatever error occurred here in the try block.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code-block-section-w60"><pre class="example"><span class="code-js">const whereAmI = async function () {
  try {
    <span class="code-comment">// code here ... </span>
  } 
  
  catch (err) {
    console.error(`${err}`);
    renderError(`${err.message}`);
  }
};</span></pre></div>
    </section>
