                    <p>white-space specifies how white-space is handled inside an element. Value are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>normal</strong> - This is default</li>
                        <li><strong>nowrap</strong> - Text will never wrap to the next line. The text continues on the same line until a &lt;br&gt; tag is encountered.</li>
                        <li><strong>pre</strong> - Text will never wrap to the next line. Acts like the &lt;pre&gt; tag in HTML. Text will only wrap if the HTML is formatted that way, or if you use a &lt;br&gt; tag. Text will also indent according to how the
                            HTML is formatted.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>pre-line</strong> - Same as &lt;pre&gt; in that text will wrap how HTML is formatted, or if you use a &lt;br&gt; tag. But it's different in that text will still wrap when necessary, for example, if the browser window can't
                            view it all, it will automatically wrap. Also, HTML formatting is ignored for indented text. Only line breaks are recognized in HTML.</li>
                        <li><strong>pre-wrap</strong> - This is the same as pre-line, except that indented text is recognized, just like 'pre'. The difference from 'pre' is that the text eventually wraps.</li>
                    </ul>
