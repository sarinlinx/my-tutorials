  <h1>When to use Node.js</h1>
  <div class="text-section">

  </div>





  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>Node.js is single threaded (only 1 process running).</p>
    <img src="../../_img/synchronous.png" width="450px">
    <p>All users accessing your app are accessing the same thread.</p>

    <img src="../../_img/blocked.png" width="450px">
    <p>This means if a user blocks a thread, all other users must wait until its execution finishes.</p>
    <img src="../../_img/asynchronous.png" width="450px">
    <p>With asynchronous code, the users are not blocked in a single thread since the longer running process is
      executing in the background.</p>
    <p>When finished exeucting in the background, a callback function is run.</p>

  </div>




  <h1>Node Architecture</h1>

  <h2>Node dependencies</h2>

  <div class="text-section">
    <p>Node has several dependencies, but the most important are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>V8 engine</li>
      <li>libuv</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="../../_img/node-architecture.png" width="550px">
  </div>


  <h3>V8 engine</h3>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>The V8 engine is what converts JavaScript code into machine code that a computer can actually understand.</p>
    <p>But, that alone is not enough to create a whole server side framework like Node.</p>
    <P>V8 is Written in JavaScript and C++.</p>

  </div>

  <h3>libuv</h3>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>libuv is needed in addition to V8 to create the server side framework. libuv is an open source library with a
      strong focus on asynchronous IO.</p>
    <p>This layer is what gives Node access to the underlying computer operating system, file
      system, networking, and more.</p>
    <p>libuv also implements two extremely important features of Node.JS</p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="text-object">the event loop</span>: responsible for handling easy tasks like executing call backs
        and network IO</li>
      <li><span class="text-object">the thread pool</span>: the event loop is while the thread pool is for more heavy
        work like file access or
        compression or something like that.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>libuv is completely written in C++.</P>
  </div>




  <h2>Processes, Threads, and the Thread Pool</h2>

  <div class="text-section">
    <p>Node runs a single process.</p>
    <p>In this process, Node runs a single thread which can be thought of as a sequence of instructions.</p>
    <p>When the program is initialized, all the top level code is executed, which means all the code that is not inside
      any callback function. Also, all the modules that your app needs are required and all the callbacks are
      registered.</p>
    <p>Then, the Event Loop starts running. The event loop is where most of the work is done in your app. So, it's
      really the heart of the entire Node architecture.</p>
  </div>

  <img src="../../_img/node-processes.png" width="650px">

  <h3>Thread Pool</h3>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>Some tasks are too heavy to be executed in the event loop because they would then block the single thread. That's
      where the thread pool comes in, which just like the event loop, is provided to Node.js by the libuv library.</p>
    <p>Node automatically offloads blocking operations into the thread pool, where they don't block the event loop.</p>
  </div>


  <h2>The Event Loop</h2>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>The event loop is the heart of the Node architecture. It is where all the application code that is inside
      callback functions is executed. So, all code that is not top level code will run in the event loop.</p>
    <p>The Event Loop is what makes asynchronous programming possible in Node.js, making it the most important feature
      in Node's design and making Node.js completely different from other platforms.</p>

    <p>It takes care of all incoming events and performs orchestration by offloading heavier tasks into the thread pool,
      and doing the most simple work itself.</p>

    <p>Node uses Event-Triggered-Architecture.</p>
    <p>As soon as an event completes, the Event Loop picks them up and calls their callback functions.</p>
    <p>It's often said that the event loop does the orchestration, which simply means that it receives events, calls
      their callback functions, and offloads the more expensive tasks to the thread pool.</p>
    <p>It's very important for you to correctly understand the event loop so that you can write your own performing code
      and also debug your own code when something goes wrong in an unexpected way.</p>



    <p>The Event Loop is also needed because in Node.js everything works in one single thread, so you can have thousands
      or millions
      of users accessing the same thread at the same time. This makes Node so lightweight and scalable, but at the same
      time, it comes with the danger of blocking our single thread, which would make the entire app slow or even stop
      for all your users accessing the app.</p>

    <h4>Guidelines to not block the Event Loop</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Don't use the sync versions of functions in the fs, crypto, or zlib modules in your callback functions.</li>
      <li>Don't perform very complex calculations in the event loop.</li>
      <li>Be careful with JSON in very large objects because at some point, it can start to take a long time to parse,
        or to stringify, JSON.</li>
      <li>Don't use all too complex regular expressions, for example, with multiple nested quantifiers or back
        references, because again, they can take longer than expected.</li>
    </ul>


  </div>
  <img src="../../_img/event-loop.png" width="650px">

  <h3>Order callbacks are executed</h3>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>When an application starts, the event loop starts running right away. The event loop has multiple phases, and
      each phase has a callback queue, which are the callbacks coming from the events that the event loop receives.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>4 phases</h3>

  <h4>Expired timer callbacks</h4>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>The first phase takes care of callbacks of expired timers, for example, from the <span
        class="code">setTimeout()</span> function. If there
      are callback functions from timers that just expired, these are the first ones to be processed by the Event Loop.
    </p>
    <p> If a timer expires later during the time when one of the other phases are being processed, then the callback of
      that timer will only be called as soon as the event loop comes back to this first phase.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>I/O polling and callbacks</h4>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>Polling means looking for new I/O events that are ready to be processed and putting them into the callback queue.
    </p>
    <p>I/O means stuff like networking and file access,so it's in this phase where 99% of code gets executed.</p>
    <p>This is because in a typical Node app, the bulk of what needs to get done is related to networking and also, file
      accessing.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>setImmediate callbacks</h4>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p><span class="code">setImmediate</span> is a special kind of timer that processes callbacks immediately after the
      I/O polling and execution phase.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Close callbacks</h4>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>In this phase, all close events are processed, for example, for when a web server or a WebSocket shut down.
    </p>
  </div>


  <h3>2 additional queues</h3>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>If there are any callbacks in one of these two queues to be processed, they will be executed right after the
      current 4 phases of the Event Loop finishes.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>nextTick() queue</h3>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>Used for advanced use cases.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>microtasks queue</h3>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>Used for resolved promises.</p>
  </div>

  <h1>Events and Event Driven Architecture</h1>

  <div class="text-section">
    <p>In Node, there are certain objects called <span class="text-object">event emitters</span> that emit named events
      as soon as something important happens in the app, like a request hitting server, or a timer expiring, or a file
      finishing to read.</p>
    <p>These events can then be picked up by <span class="text-object">event listeners</span> that we developers set up,
      which will fire off callback functions that are attached to each listener.
  </div>
  <img src="../../_img/events.png" width="750px">


  <h1>Streams</h1>

  <div class="text-section">
    <p>With streams we can process meaning read and write data piece by piece without completing the whole read or write
      operation.</p>
    <p>Therefore we don't have to keep all the data in memory to do these operations.</p>
    <p> For example, when we read a file using streams, we read part of the data, do something with it, then free our
      memory, and repeat this until the entire file has been processed. Or think of YouTube or Netflix, which are both
      called streaming companies because they stream video using the same principle.</p>
    <p>This makes streams the perfect candidate for handing large volumes of data like for example, video or also data
      that we're receiving piece by piece from an external source.</p>
  </div>
  <img src="../../_img/streams.png" width="750px">

  <h2>4 types of streams</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Readable Streams</li>
    <li>Writable Streams</li>
    <li>Duplex Streams</li>
    <li>Transform Streams</li>
  </ul>

  <img src="../../_img/streams-4-types.png" width="750px">

  <div class="text-section">
    <p>These events and functions are for consuming streams that are already implemented. So for example, Node
      implemented these http requests and responses as streams, and we can then consume, we can use them using the
      events and functions that are available for each type of stream.</p>
    <p>It's more important to know how to consume streams, not how to implement them.</p>
  </div>




  <h1>Requiring Modules</h1>

  <img src="../../_img/require-function.png" width="750px">
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>What happens each time we require a module by calling the <span class="code">require</span> function with a
      module name as the argument? As a very broad overview, the following steps are executed behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>First, the path to the required module is resolved and the file is loaded.</p>
    <p> Then a process called wrapping happens</p>
    <p>The module code is executed</p>
    <p>The module exports are returned</p>
    <p>Finally the entire module gets cached</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Resolving & Loading</h2>
  <div class="text-section">
    <img src="../../_img/resolving.png" width="750px">
    <p>How does node know which file to load when we require a module?</p>
    <p>When the require functions receives the module name as its input, it will first try to load a core module with
      that name. Like for example, the http module. It will automatically find a path to that module and then load it.
    </p>
    <p>If the path starts with a dot, or two dots, it means that it's a developer module. Because we indicate the
      relative path to our file. So node will try to load that file.</p>
    <p>If there is no file with that name, then it will look for a folder instead and load <span
        class="text-object">index.js</span> if it's in that folder. In case there is no file at this path, it will then,
      instead, try to open index.js from the lib/controller folder instead.</p>
    <p>If the required module is neither a core module, nor a developer module, node will assume it's a module from npm.
      On a module that we load from npm, we actually don't need to write the path when we require it. Just the module
      name, just the way it works on a core module. So these third party modules are stored in a <span
        class="text-object">node_modules</span> folder, so node will step into that folder and try to find a module
      there and then load it.</p>
  </div>


  <h2>Wrapping</h2>
  <img src="../../_img/wrapping.png" width="750px">

  <div class="text-section">
    <p>After the module is loaded, the module's code is wrapped into a special function which will give us access to a
      couple of special objects.</p>
    <p>It is here where we get the answer to the question, where does the require function actually come from and why do
      we have access to it? It's because the nodejs run time, takes the code off our module and puts it inside the
      immediately invoked function expression, or IIFE that you can see here.</p>
    <p>node does not directly execute the code that I rewrite into a file, but instead, the wrapper function that will
      contain our code in it's body.</p>
    <p> It also passes the exports, require, module, __filename, and __dirname objects into it.</p>
    <p>So that is why in every module we automatically have access to stuff like the require function.
      So these are basically like global variables that are injected into each and every module.</p>
    <p>By doing this, node achieves two very important things.</p>
    <p> First, is giving developers access to all these variables we just talked about, which is very helpful.</p>
    <p> Second, it keeps the top-level variables that we define in our modules private. So it's scoped only to the
      current module instead of leaking everything into the global object.</p>
  </div>


  <h3>Execution</h3>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>The code in the module's wrapper function gets executed by the Nod.js runtime.</p>
  </div>


  <h3>Returning Exports</h3>
  <img src="../../_img/returning-exports.png" width="750px">
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>Now, it's time for the <span class="code">require</span> function to return something. And what it returns is the
      exports of the required module.</p>
    <p> These exports are stored in the <span class="code">module.exports</span> object.</p>
    <p>So, again, in each module we can export variables, which will, in the end be returned by the require function.
      And we do that by assigning variables to module.exports or simply to exports where it is just a pointer to
      module.export.</p>
    <p>When to use module.export or just export?</p>
    <p>If all you want to do is to export one single variable, like one class or one function, you usually use
      module.exports and set it equal to the variable that you want to export.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if you're looking to export multiple named variables like multiple functions, for example,
      then you should create these as properties of the export object.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Caching</h3>
  <div class="text-section">
    <p>The last step is that modules are actually cached after the first time they are loaded. What this means is that
      if you require the same module multiple times, you will always get the same result. And the code in the modules is
      actually only executed in the first call. In subsequent calls,the result is simply retrieved from cache.</p>
  </div>
